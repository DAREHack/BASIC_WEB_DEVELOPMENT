    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Emerging technologies are innovations that have the potential to transform industries, 
        reshape societies, and revolutionize the way we live and work. 
        Here are some of the notable ones:</strong>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(205, 16, 170);text-decoration: underline;text-align: left; ">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="color: blue;">Artificial intelligence (AI)</span> is the sub-intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents," where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. <strong>John McCarth</strong>, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".</p>

         <h2 style="color: rgb(32, 172, 172);text-align: left; text-decoration: underline;">ROBOTICS</h2>
         <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Robotics</span> is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, 
            as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes,
             or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition.

         <h2 style="color: blueviolet;text-decoration: underline;">QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY</h2>
         <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">Quantum Cryptography</span>is the science of exploiting quantum mechnaical properties to perfomr cryptographic tasks.The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-historically secure solution to the key exchange problem.The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical communication.

         </p>
         <h2 style="color: cornflowerblue; text-decoration: underline;">ELECTRONIC NOSE</h2>
         <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">Electronic Nose</span> is an electronic sensing device intended to detect odors (or) flavors.The expression "electronic sensing"refers to the capability of reproducing human senses using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems.Since 1982, research has been conducted to develop technologies, commonly referred to as electronic noses, that could detect and recognize odors and flavors.
             The stages of the recognition process are similar to human olfaction and are performed for identification, comparison, quantification and other retrieval.Some such devices are used for industrial purposes.
